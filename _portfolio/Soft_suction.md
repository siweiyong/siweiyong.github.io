Suction adhesion is widely used by natural creatures for gripping irregular objects (e.g., rocks), but their artificial counterparts show less adaptation in the same situation. In addition they can require complex sensing and control systems to function. In this paper, we present a contact-triggered suction cup with the ability to adapt to objects with complex and irregular shapes. The gripper has two states to adhere and release the object and the transformation from release to adhesion is passively triggered by the contact force, making it an autonomous gripper and removing the need for complex driven system. Once the suction cup is exerted by a contact force more than 11.41 N, it will automatically capture the contacting object. Only the resetting transformation from adhesion to release is actuated by a vacuum pump. The maximal suction force up to 15.1 N is generated on the non-flat surface with the diameter of 30 mm. The performance of this gripper is demonstrated on a 7 DoF robot arm which successfully picked up a variety of irregular objects. We believe that this morphologically intelligent contact-triggered gripper provides a new solution for low cost, energy-effective and universal soft gripping.<br/><img src='/images/soft_grasping2.gif'>
