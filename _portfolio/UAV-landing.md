title: "UAV landing on moving vehicle autonomously"
excerpt: " In this project, we developed a vision-based UAV autonomous landing solution on a moving car. This project designed a new landing pad and its recognition algorithm to achieve relative pose estimation with high sampling rate.  Utilization of monocular gimbaled camera expand the field of view and improves the reliability of identification as well. All above investigates solutions for the challenging problem of autonomous landing on a moving vehicle of multi-rotors Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.<br/><img src='/images/UAVLanding.gif'>"

This paper presents the design of a new landing pad and its recognition algorithm to achieve relative pose estimation with high sampling rate. The landing pad consists of multiple markers, which is a kind of simplified Apriltags. Small markers are overlaid on the large marker, make it possible to have a wide detection range in a limited pad area. Utilization of monocular gimbaled camera expand the field of view and improves the reliability of identification as well. All above investigates solutions for the challenging problem of autonomous landing on a moving vehicle of multi-rotors Unmanned Aerial Vehicles <br/><img src='/images/UAVLanding.gif'>.
