In this paper, an impedance control-based framework for human-robot composite layup skill transfer was developed, and the human-in-the-loop mechanism was investigated to achieve human-robot skill transfer. Although there are some works on human-robot skill transfer, it is still difficult to transfer the manipulation skill to robots through teleoperation efficiently and intuitively. In this article, we developed an impedance-based control architecture of telemanipulation in task space for the human-robot skill transfer through teleoperation. This framework not only achieves human-robot skill transfer but also provides a solution to human-robot collaboration through teleoperation. The variable impedance control system enables the compliant interaction between the robot and the environment, smooth transition between different stages. Dynamic movement primitives based learning from demonstration is employed to model the human manipulation skills, and the learnt skill can be generalized to different tasks and environments, such as the different shapes of components and different orientations of components. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on a 7 DoF Franka Panda through the robot-assisted composite layup on different shapes and orientations of the components <br/><img src='/images/composite-layup.gif'>.
