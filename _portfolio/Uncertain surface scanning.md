title: "A human-robot collaboration method for uncertain surface scanning"
excerpt: "This paper presents a multimodal human-robot interaction system integrating vision-language models (Florence 2), language interpretation (Llama 3.1), and speech recognition (Whisper) with fuzzy logic for precise control of a Dobot Magician robotic arm. Initial tests show 75% accuracy, highlighting its potential for more natural, efficient human-robot collaboration.<br/><img src='/images/robot ultrasound system.jpg'>"

Understanding human intentions is becoming a critical aspect of human-robot interaction (HRI), bringing machine collaboration closer to natural human communication. This paper introduces a novel approach by integrating state-of-the-art vision-language models and speech processing with fuzzy logic for precise control of a Dobot Magician robotic arm. Leveraging Florence 2 for object detection, Llama 3.1 for language interpretation, and Whisper for speech recognition, the system offers an intuitive interface for seamless object manipulation. Our multimodal approach addresses the challenges of s
